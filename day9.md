## Introduction to HTML and Web basics:-
### HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
### How browsers render it:-
When the browser receives an HTML document, it parses the HTML code to create a tree-like structure called the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM represents the web page's structure and includes all of the elements and attributes defined in the HTML code. The second step in the rendering process is parsing CSS.
### structure of HTML documents:-
An HTML document has a specific structure that includes a document type declaration, the root <html> element, a <head> section for metadata, and a <body> section for visible content. The basic structure is the foundation upon which all web pages are built. 

1. <!DOCTYPE html>:
This declaration, located at the very beginning of the document, tells the browser which version of HTML is being used, which in this case is HTML5. 
It's not an HTML tag, but a declaration that provides information about the document to the browser. 
2. <html> element:
The <html> tag acts as the root element, enclosing all other elements within the document.
It signifies that the content is written in HTML. 
3. <head> section:
The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document. 
It's not displayed directly in the browser window but is crucial for how the browser processes and displays the page. 
<title>: Defines the title of the HTML page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. 
<meta>: Provides metadata about the document, like character encoding, viewport settings, and information for search engines. 
<link>: Links external resources such as CSS stylesheets or JavaScript files. 
<style>: Embeds internal CSS styles. 
<script>: Embeds JavaScript code for dynamic functionality. 
4. <body> section:
The <body> section contains the actual content of the webpage that is visible to the user. 
It can include headings, paragraphs, images, links, videos, and other elements.
