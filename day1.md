# Training day 1
I am **Kirandeep kaur**. I'm a second year CSE student. Today was the first day of my **15 days summer training** in the **Computer Science Department** . I was very excited to start my study in my parent branch . Firstly there was an **orientation program** conducted for us in the **auditorium** . Here , we interacted with **Dr. Priyanka** . she is a  professor in **Computer Science department** . She gave us all the necessary information that was required and also welcomed all the students in **cse department** who are going to be part of the parent branch . Then , we interacted with **Head of Department, Dr. Kiran Jyoti** . She  introduced a new scheme for **2024 year onwards students**. After this interaction , all the students moved to their labs . In the lab , our teacher explained the syllabus of this training that all  students will study in these training days . on the  first day we discussed about **Linux** & **its importance** then why most of the **companies** & **coders** use **Linux** over **Windows** ? due to following reasons:- 
- Linux is **more secure** due to its permission-based system than windows.
- - Linux is **free** , while windows required paid license.
- Linux is **open source** , so it can be easily available.
- Linux has large community.

### Introduction to linux:
Linux was developed by a person named Linus in 1991. Linux is a powerful, open source operating system.
Linux is preferred over windows due to its various features such as Open Source,Free Stability, Reliability , Provides Security, Run efficiently ,Developer Friendly etc.
### Difference between Linux and Windows
|Features      |           Linux|             Windows|
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
|**Cost**	|Usually free|	Paid license required|
|**Source code**|	Open source(free to access)|	Not an open source|
|**Security**	|It is more secure as admin password is required |	It is not secure as there is a risk of viruses|
|**Stability**	|Very stable|	Can be less stable|
|**Customizability**|	Linux offers extensive customization options, allowing users to modify everything from the desktop environment to the core components|	Windows provides limited customization compared to Linux, with more rigid control over the core structure and functionalities|

***Installing Linux Operating System*** It include installation of three softwares:
